Hello, and again welcome to the Aperture Science computed-aided enrichment center. We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
Your specimen has been processed, and we are now ready to begin the test proper. Keep in mind that although fun, and learning are the primary goal of all enrichment
center activities. Serious injuries may occur. For your safety and the safety of others, please refrain from, *GARBLED SPANISH* I'm back.
The portal will open in three, two, one.
